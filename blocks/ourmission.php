This is the experience our members are SUPPOSED to have and the mindset the clan was founded under:
<hr>
<ul>
<li>This clan has a moral obligation to do the right thing, whether you like doing it or not. This means respecting any member of this community and non-community members that you run across in-game. You MUST treat these people with absolute respect as you are a direct representation of this clan and community.
</li><hr>
<li>We do not cheat. Simple. We believe it is unfair for someone play the game unfairly and use cheats/hacks that gives the player an extreme advantage over another person. We believe that if you want to get better and have skill within the game, you MUST learn through trial and error. This is a direct correlation into the real world as in life, you can't cheat to succeed.
</li><hr>
<li>At the end of the day we are all players. It doesn't matter what your KDR was in a certain match of the fact you killed everyone that got caught in your line of sight. All of us are people at the end of the day with lives and goals and ambitions outside of gaming. Bashing people because of skill (whether good or bad skill), is unacceptable behavior for any member of the {IB} Clan. It is alright however, to poke fun at someone in a joking manner, as long as you do so in the right taste and not offend the person. If they do become offended by this, refrain from doing it to that person.
</li><hr>
<li>Hard work leads to great rewards. You are not "given" anything within this clan. If you want a certain rank or a certain position within the clan, you MUST work to prove that you DESERVE the position/rank. We believe this mindset carries over into the real world where you'll be able to use this to help yourself get to where you want to be.
</li><hr>
<li>We are all about fun within this clan. This is why we do not restrict people based on their play styles, experience, or age. However, we do ask that you act maturely as immaturity will cause a direct drop in reputation within the minds of people not involved within this community.
</li><hr>
<li>As the previous point on reputation, we strive to be the most respected clan that we possibly can be. This means if you want a positive reputation of this clan and even yourself, follow these moral codes of Infernal Blaze.
</li><hr>
<li>All moral guidelines this clan was founded under have direct meanings to real life situations. We believe in helping community members strive to be the BEST person they can be in life, inside and outside of the gaming world.
