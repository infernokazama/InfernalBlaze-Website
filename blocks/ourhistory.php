Well, you're here. You might as well stop what you're doing, grab some popcorn and something to drink as I take you back through the history of Infernal Blaze (From the VERY Beginning)

<center><h3 class="font">2005 - The Foundation</h3>

Back in 2005, I came across the MMORPG called City of Heroes. While playing the game, I created my character InfernoKazama (which has become my internet alias now) and made a SuperGroup of Heroes at level 10 called, oddly enough, InfernoBlaze. I had fun on the game (considering I hadn't found my niche in FPS Games yet) and made friends and started recruiting members. However I was cut short of this due to me being only 15 years old at the time and did not have a way to continue paying the subscription.

However, I was in luck not long after I was forced to quit the game. My friend of 4 years (now 12 years) showed me Halo for the PC. I was instantly addicted. I played Halo on the Xbox before, so I wasn't a complete and total noob at the series. So, I downloaded the Trial Version and started playing in the trial servers. I got bored of Bloodgulch being the only map you could play so I downloaded the cracked version and started playing it on there. It wasn't long before I started noticing clans in the Halo world, and I remembered what a clan was back during my days playing Age of Empires II, so I knew a little bit about the atmosphere.

After a couple of VERY minor stays in clans, I decided to make my own clan. I didn't like how the other clans were run and I knew there could be something different around other than having the guys that only cared about how skilled you were in the game and talked bad about you if you couldn't perform to their standards. I knew that's not what a clan should be, so I made Infernal Blaze in hopes of changing that.

Infernal Blaze was officially founded in 2006 as Inferno Blaze, but was later changed about 4 months after founding to sound better. We had a semi-successful run on the Cracked Version of Halo PC before I pulled the plug on that by actually buying the retail copy.

After that, members dropped to Zero as I started fresh with new members. Infernal Blaze was basically a brain-child of mine with no direction.

Ok, I created the clan......now what?

I was absolutely clueless. I started to realize that becoming the leader of the clan forced me to either learn the tricks of the trade or find someone who knew how to do it. I wasn't satisfied with not knowing how to do the things necessary, so I embarked on learning Web Design, and boy has it paid off. I was 16 when I started learning. I took every bit of information and put it to use in some way.

Along the journey, I found =DG= (Dark Guardians). Due to how successful they were, I almost gave up and joined them, but a voice in the back of my mind thought, maybe I can apply the techniques that made them successful and add my own twist to them. I did just that. I asked all the questions I could about leading and managing a clan until Snipes and Hostile were about to run me off a couple of times. I give them a lot of credit for helping me in the clan admin role, because if it were not for them, Infernal Blaze would not exist today.

The year 2007 brought many ups and downs for the clan. The most memorable news were the Announcement of our No Multi-Clanning Rule, Slim Killer replacing Sergiekun as Second in Command, the supposed passing of Phoenix (had muscular dystrophy, stopped appearing online), Shiny and Kamp3r botting, and Socom hacking Public Teamspeak Servers. A lot of that brought good to the clan and bad. However we triumphed through those times and came out stronger.

Along the Journey, we created a close relationship with ally clan, Delta Fighter Wing (=DFW=) and helped each other out on several occasions.

Socom created a lot of Modded maps that can still be found on Halo Maps. Just look up -IB- School and you'll find his work.

The year of 2008 was troubling for Infernal Blaze. We had members dropping and I was making life altering decisions in my own life joining the US Army. I resigned my duties of Leader of Infernal Blaze a month before I was shipped off to basic and fully relinquished my duties one week before I shipped off.

2 months passed, and I could not tell you what had happened, but when I came back......Infernal Blaze was a mess. So mad at what was going on, I decided to come back and restore things to the way they once were, but that didn't last long as a tragic event would stop my involvement with Infernal Blaze for good then.

My father passed away on November 5th, 2008 and that marked the end of my role as leader for the original Infernal Blaze.

In 2009, both {IB} and =DFW= merged together and created =TRA=. The run was semi-successful but fell apart due to the stagnation of recruiting. =DFW= split off again to re-create their clan and {IB} was left disbanded.

<center><h3 class="font">2012 - The Rebirth</h3></center>

As I had continued on with my life and moved away from Online Gaming, I had missed it. So, when I finally got the chance to play online games again, I was thrilled.

I re-installed Halo CE, just for nostalgia, thinking it might have been dead. Boy, was I wrong. However I started to notice the community had indeed shifted like I had thought....noticing there wasn't as many English speaking players as there were before. When browsing the server list, I noticed a VERY familiar clan tag, =DG=. Now thinking this could be another clan using the same tags, I decided to enter. When I saw the server status saying Dark Guardians, I thought this was some elaborate hoax, so I immediately checked it out to see if my suspicions were right. Turns out, I had stumbled upon the reborn =DG= clan. Fueled by the knowledge the =DG= clan survived, maybe {IB} can rise up again, and so I restarted the clan in 2012.

I hope you enjoyed the show. Now, get off your couch potato behind and start doing something. God, you must be insane to still be reading this.

Seriously. Go already.
